## Usage

To use this plugin, add `user_permission` as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

### Get status

```dart
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission.dart';
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission_type.dart';

final state = await UserPermission().state(UserPermissionType.usageStats);
```

### Launch screen & Detect status change

```dart
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission.dart';
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission_type.dart';

final state = await UserPermission().startWatching(UserPermissionType.systemAlertWindow);
```

### Status value

The status can be either `denied` or `granted`.  
If denied, it's a good idea to ask the user for permission with `startWatching`.

```dart
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission.dart';
import 'package:user_permission/user_permission_type.dart';

final userPermission = UserPermission();
final state = await userPermission.state(UserPermissionType.usageStats);
if (state.isDenied) {
    await userPermission.startWatching(UserPermissionType.usageStats);
}
```
